## What is Shoutrrr?

Shoutrrr is a social media scheduling tool you run yourself. Connect your accounts, draft a post once, and send it to every network at the same time — or queue it to go out on a recurring schedule. No monthly seat fees, no third party holding your tokens or your data.

It's built for individuals and teams: invite collaborators into a shared workspace, keep clients or brands separated, and see how your posts perform — all from a single, fast interface.

## Why Shoutrrr?

- **You own everything** — your posts, your audience tokens, your analytics. Self-hosted on your infrastructure.
- **One post, every platform** — compose once and publish to multiple accounts, tweaking the text per network when you want.
- **Plan ahead** — a posting queue with recurring time slots and a month calendar, so your feed stays consistent without you babysitting it.
- **Made for teams** — workspaces, roles, and email invites keep clients and collaborators tidy.
- **No vendor lock-in** — open source under the Apache 2.0 license, runs anywhere Docker does.

## Features

- 📝 **Composer** — draft with media and alt text, see live per-account text and video limits (including detected X subscription limits), and automatically split long posts into threads where the platform supports it.
- 🚀 **Multi-account publishing** — fan one post out to many accounts at once, with optional per-platform overrides. Each target publishes independently and retries on failure.
- 🗓️ **Queue & calendar** — set recurring posting slots (in your workspace's timezone), drop drafts into the queue, and review everything on a month calendar. Publish instantly whenever you like.
- 📊 **Analytics** — follower and post-count trends per account, plus per-post engagement (likes, reposts, replies, impressions) where the provider API supports it.
- 🔗 **Connected accounts** — link accounts via OAuth (X, LinkedIn, Meta, TikTok, YouTube) or app password (Bluesky), group them into reusable sets, and get nudged when one needs reconnecting. Tokens are stored encrypted and refreshed automatically; a successful authenticated X tier refresh also restores a stale attention state.
- 👥 **Workspaces & team** — multiple workspaces with role-based memberships, email invitations, and ownership transfer. Every bit of data is scoped to its workspace.
- 🔔 **Notifications** — in-app alerts when a post publishes or fails, or when an account needs attention.
- 🔐 **Secure by default** — email/password with verification, two-factor (TOTP), passkeys (WebAuthn), and optional social login (Google, X, LinkedIn).

## Self-hosting

The recommended way to host this fork on one server is its prebuilt Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/danielapassos/dani-fully:latest
```

The image runs the web app, queue worker, and scheduler in one container — ideal for a single box. It defaults to SQLite with no external services, and you can switch to Postgres/Redis later if you need to scale out.

### Quick start with `docker run`

Create a production env file:

```bash
cat > .env.prod <<'EOF'
APP_URL=http://localhost:8080
APP_KEY=base64:PASTE_GENERATED_KEY_HERE
EOF
```

Generate an `APP_KEY` and paste it into `.env.prod`:

```bash
docker run --rm --entrypoint php ghcr.io/danielapassos/dani-fully:latest /var/www/html/artisan key:generate --show
```

Start Shoutrrr with persistent volumes:

```bash
docker volume create shoutrrr-storage
docker volume create shoutrrr-sqlite

docker run -d \
  --name shoutrrr \
  --env-file .env.prod \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v shoutrrr-storage:/var/www/html/storage \
  -v shoutrrr-sqlite:/var/www/html/database/sqlite \
  ghcr.io/danielapassos/dani-fully:latest
```

Shoutrrr runs its startup tasks automatically, including database migrations. Open `http://localhost:8080`, register the first account, and you're in. The image defaults to production mode, SQLite, database-backed cache/queue/session storage, one in-container queue worker, one scheduler, and SSR disabled.

The image accepts videos up to Shoutrrr's 1 GiB application ceiling by default. Local-disk uploads stream the request body straight to storage and the app bounds how many bytes it writes, so memory and disk usage stay flat no matter the video size. If you place it behind a reverse proxy, set that proxy's request-body limit to at least 1.1 GiB too, and keep `PHP_POST_MAX_SIZE` above the ceiling so a legitimate large upload isn't rejected up front. For large or production deployments, configure S3-compatible object storage (`FILESYSTEM_DISK=s3`): uploads then go directly to storage and never pass through the app at all.

For a real public deployment, set `APP_URL` to your HTTPS domain and set `SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true`. To test a specific release candidate, replace `latest` with a version tag such as `1.0.0-rc.2` in the commands above.

To reset all local test data:

```bash
docker rm -f shoutrrr
docker volume rm shoutrrr-storage shoutrrr-sqlite
```

### Docker Compose

If you prefer Compose, use the bundled production file. `SHOUTRRR_IMAGE` makes the image source explicit so a fork checkout cannot silently run upstream code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielapassos/dani-fully.git
cd dani-fully
cp .env.example.prod .env

# Set APP_KEY, APP_URL, and SHOUTRRR_IMAGE in .env before starting.
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yaml run --rm app php artisan key:generate --show

docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yaml up -d
```

Shoutrrr runs its startup tasks automatically, including database migrations. The production template also enables first-use Passport key generation; the generated pair lives on the persistent `storage` volume, so API/MCP tokens survive redeploys on this single-server setup. `docker-compose.development.yaml` builds the image locally from source instead.

Set `INERTIA_SSR_ENABLED=true` for server-side rendering. To run the worker/scheduler as separate services in the cloud, set `QUEUE_WORKER_ENABLED=false` / `SCHEDULER_ENABLED=false` and override the container command (e.g. `php artisan queue:work`).

### Deploy with Coolify

[Coolify](https://coolify.io) reads the bundled Compose file from this repo and runs a prebuilt GHCR image — it handles the domain, HTTPS, and persistent volumes for you. The Compose file does not build the checked-out source.

> Publish the fork's image before deploying: a merge to `main` alone does not create or update `:latest`. Publish a GitHub Release for the versioned and `latest` tags, or manually run the Release workflow and set `SHOUTRRR_IMAGE` to its generated `sha-*` tag.

1. In Coolify, click **+ New → Resource** and pick **Public Repository** (or Private, via the GitHub App). Enter `https://github.com/danielapassos/dani-fully`.
2. Set the **Build Pack** to **Docker Compose** and the **Docker Compose file** to `docker-compose.production.yaml`.
3. Under the `app` service, add a **Domain** pointing at port **8080**. Coolify provisions the TLS certificate automatically.
4. Add these **Environment Variables**:

    | Variable    | Value                                                                        |
    | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `APP_KEY`   | a Laravel key — generate one with `php artisan key:generate --show`          |
    | `APP_URL`   | your domain, e.g. `https://social.example.com` (must match the domain above) |
    | `APP_ENV`   | `production`                                                                 |
    | `APP_DEBUG` | `false`                                                                      |
    | `SHOUTRRR_IMAGE` | `ghcr.io/danielapassos/dani-fully:latest`                            |

    Add your `X_*`, `LINKEDIN_*`, `FACEBOOK_*`, `INSTAGRAM_*`, `TIKTOK_*`, `THREADS_*`, and `GOOGLE_*`/`YOUTUBE_*` credentials here too (see [Connecting your accounts](#connecting-your-accounts)).

5. Click **Deploy**.

The Compose file declares named volumes for `storage` and the SQLite database, so your data and uploads survive redeploys. To run against managed Postgres/Redis instead, point the `DB_*` / `REDIS_*` env vars at them and switch `DB_CONNECTION`, `CACHE_STORE`, and `QUEUE_CONNECTION` accordingly.

### Deploy on Laravel Cloud (no Docker required)

Laravel Cloud builds this repository and runs the web app, scheduler, and queues as managed services, so Docker does not need to run on your Mac. Connect this GitHub repository, then:

1. Attach Postgres, a cache, and an object-storage bucket. Configure the bucket through the existing `s3` disk and set `FILESYSTEM_DISK=s3`; if you add another named S3-compatible disk in `config/filesystems.php`, that configured name is supported too. Its CORS policy must allow browser `PUT` and `GET` from `APP_URL` and expose `ETag`, because the editor reads the uploaded source back directly.
2. Use a **public** bucket for media providers that fetch by URL. Copy the bucket's public URL from Cloud into `PUBLIC_MEDIA_URL` (Cloud displays this as `AWS_URL` but does not inject it automatically). Verify that exact HTTPS domain or prefix in the TikTok developer app before enabling `TIKTOK_INBOX_ENABLED`.
3. Keep Cloud's normal Composer/PHP build steps, replace its default npm asset lines with `npm install -g bun`, `bun install --frozen-lockfile`, and `bun run build`, and run `php artisan migrate --force` as the deploy command.
4. Enable the scheduler. Every scheduled command uses `onOneServer()`, so an autoscaled environment will not dispatch the same work from every replica.
5. Add a managed queue. `PublishPostTarget` may run longer than 90 seconds during provider video uploads, so use a Pro managed queue or a worker cluster sized for that job.
6. Store one stable `PASSPORT_PRIVATE_KEY` / `PASSPORT_PUBLIC_KEY` pair as secrets and keep `PASSPORT_AUTO_GENERATE_KEYS=false`. Cloud filesystems are ephemeral and not shared between replicas.

`APP_URL` and every OAuth redirect must use the final HTTPS Cloud/custom domain. Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Threads, and the other provider credentials still require their respective developer-console review and consent; attaching Cloud resources does not complete those external gates.

### Security headers & Content-Security-Policy

Outside `local`, Shoutrrr sends a strict, nonce-based **Content-Security-Policy** along with `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, and (in production) `Strict-Transport-Security`. This is deliberate hardening — but if you customise the frontend or front the app with an unusual proxy/CDN, it's the first place to look when something renders wrong.

**If the UI loads unstyled or a feature is broken, open your browser's dev console and check for CSP violations.** Common causes and fixes (all in `app/Http/Middleware/SecurityHeaders.php`):

- **Assets served from a different origin than `APP_URL`** (e.g. a CDN host) are blocked by `default-src 'self'`. Serve built assets from the app origin, or add the host to `script-src`/`style-src`/`img-src`.
- **Third-party embeds or analytics scripts** are blocked — `script-src` only trusts the app's own nonced scripts (`'strict-dynamic'`). Add the source explicitly if you need it.
- **Images/avatars from arbitrary hosts** are allowed (`img-src` permits `https:`); tighten this if you prefer.

The CSP is intentionally **not** sent in `local` (`APP_ENV=local`) because it is incompatible with the Vite dev server's hot-reload. To verify the production policy locally, run a build and serve with a non-local env (`bun run build && APP_ENV=production php artisan serve`). Note that `Strict-Transport-Security` requires the app to be served over HTTPS.

## Connecting your accounts

**Bluesky** connects two ways, and neither needs you to register a developer app:

- **OAuth (recommended)** — users sign in on Bluesky and authorize Shoutrrr without handing over a password. It's zero-config: Shoutrrr publishes an [ATProto OAuth](https://atproto.com/specs/oauth) client-metadata document at `${APP_URL}/oauth/bluesky/client-metadata.json` (with keys at `${APP_URL}/oauth/bluesky/jwks.json`), and Bluesky's authorization server fetches those to identify your instance. The signing key is generated once and stored encrypted — there's nothing to add to `.env`. **The one requirement:** `APP_URL` must be a public HTTPS URL, because Bluesky has to reach those two documents over the internet. (In `local` dev, Shoutrrr falls back to a loopback client so OAuth still works on `localhost`.)
- **App password** — users paste a Bluesky [app password](https://bsky.app/settings/app-passwords). No setup, and it works anywhere — including private or LAN deployments Bluesky can't reach for OAuth.

**X**, **LinkedIn**, the **Meta** platforms, **TikTok**, and **YouTube** use your own developer apps, so register each callback and add the credentials to `.env`. The redirect URIs must exactly match the public HTTPS URLs:

```dotenv
# X — https://developer.x.com
X_CLIENT_ID=
X_CLIENT_SECRET=
X_REDIRECT_URI="${APP_URL}/accounts/callback/x"

# LinkedIn — https://www.linkedin.com/developers
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID=
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET=
LINKEDIN_REDIRECT_URI="${APP_URL}/accounts/callback/linkedin"

# Facebook + linked Instagram — one Meta app (https://developers.facebook.com).
FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID=
FACEBOOK_CLIENT_SECRET=
FACEBOOK_REDIRECT_URI="${APP_URL}/accounts/callback/meta"

# Direct Instagram Login — Business/Creator accounts, no linked Page required.
INSTAGRAM_APP_ID=
INSTAGRAM_APP_SECRET=
INSTAGRAM_REDIRECT_URI="${APP_URL}/accounts/callback/instagram"

# Threads — a separate Meta app (https://developers.facebook.com).
THREADS_CLIENT_ID=
THREADS_CLIENT_SECRET=
THREADS_REDIRECT_URI="${APP_URL}/accounts/callback/threads"

# TikTok — creator-inbox handoff; requires app review + verified PUBLIC_MEDIA_URL.
TIKTOK_CLIENT_KEY=
TIKTOK_CLIENT_SECRET=
TIKTOK_REDIRECT_URI="${APP_URL}/accounts/callback/tiktok"
TIKTOK_INBOX_ENABLED=false

# YouTube — shares the Google client credentials below, with its own callback.
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
YOUTUBE_REDIRECT_URI="${APP_URL}/accounts/callback/youtube"
YOUTUBE_PUBLISHING_ENABLED=false
YOUTUBE_PRIVACY_STATUS=private
```

Optionally, let people sign in with a social account instead of a password:

```dotenv
SOCIALITE_ENABLED=true
SOCIALITE_PROVIDERS=google            # comma-separated: google,x,linkedin
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI="${APP_URL}/auth/google/callback"
```

> **Heads up:** publishing, scheduling, engagement polling, and analytics capture rely on a running queue worker and scheduler. The provided Docker setups start both for you. Metrics and engagement are enabled by default and can be disabled with `METRICS_ENABLED=false` / `ENGAGEMENT_ENABLED=false` (see `config/metrics.php` and `config/engagement.php`). X accounts read the authenticated account's subscription type when connected or when **Refresh tier** is used in Connected Accounts; Free accounts use a 280-character / 140-second-video limit, while Basic, Premium, and Premium+ accounts use 25,000 characters and can upload videos up to four hours. When a post targets more than one X account, the composer enforces the strictest selected account limit.

## Development

Shoutrrr is a Laravel 13 (PHP 8.5) app with a React 19 + TypeScript frontend on [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com) v3, [Tailwind v4](https://tailwindcss.com), and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com). It runs on [Laravel Octane](https://laravel.com/docs/octane) (FrankenPHP), with typed routes generated by [Wayfinder](https://github.com/laravel/wayfinder).

```bash
composer setup   # install deps, copy .env, generate app + Passport keys, bun install, build assets
composer dev     # serve + queue + scheduler + logs + Vite, all at once
```

> Uses [Bun](https://bun.sh) for the frontend (`bun install`, `bun run …`) — not npm/pnpm.

To test SMTP locally during development, run [Mailpit](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit):

```bash
docker run --rm --name mail --pull always -p 1025:1025 -p 8025:8025 axllent/mailpit:latest
```

Then set these mail values in your `.env` file:

```dotenv
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=127.0.0.1
MAIL_PORT=1025
MAIL_USERNAME=null
MAIL_PASSWORD=null
MAIL_SCHEME=null
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="hello@shoutrrr.local"
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
```

### How publishing works

A post is composed once, then split into one **target** per connected account. The scheduler dispatches due posts every minute; a queued `PublishPostTarget` job then publishes each target independently, with retries, idempotency, and a per-attempt audit trail. Scheduled jobs refresh OAuth tokens before they expire, fetch replies, and check for due metrics captures every 15 minutes. Metrics refresh cadence is controlled in `config/metrics.php`.

### API & MCP tokens

The REST API and MCP integration authenticate with bearer tokens minted by [Laravel Passport](https://laravel.com/docs/passport), which signs and verifies every token with an RSA keypair. A single-server Docker install can generate the pair automatically (`ApiKeyManager::ensureEncryptionKeysExist()` runs `passport:keys`) and store it in the persistent `storage` volume.

Production environments with ephemeral storage or more than one replica must provision one shared pair through `PASSPORT_PRIVATE_KEY` and `PASSPORT_PUBLIC_KEY`, then set `PASSPORT_AUTO_GENERATE_KEYS=false`. Otherwise one replica can mint tokens that another replica cannot verify, and a redeploy can invalidate every existing API/MCP token.

If you'd rather provision them explicitly — for example to share one keypair across multiple app instances behind a load balancer — do either of the following before issuing keys:

- Run `php artisan passport:keys` once and keep `storage` persistent, **or**
- Set the `PASSPORT_PRIVATE_KEY` and `PASSPORT_PUBLIC_KEY` env vars to the key contents (the auto-generation step is skipped when both are present).

To turn auto-generation off entirely, set `PASSPORT_AUTO_GENERATE_KEYS=false`. Issuing an API key without keys present then fails loudly instead of writing new ones — useful when the keypair is managed externally and Shoutrrr must never mint its own.
